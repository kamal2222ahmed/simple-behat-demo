## Sample Run

```
Feature: Teams
    In order to manage teams
    As a staff member
    I need to be able to create teams

  Background:                       # features\create_team.feature:20
    Given user "admin" exists       # FeatureContext::userExists()
    Given user "admin" is a "admin" # FeatureContext::userIsA()
    Given user "test" exists        # FeatureContext::userExists()

  Scenario Outline: Team Creating                                                      # features\create_team.feature:25
    Given I am logged in as "admin"                                                    # FeatureContext::loggedInAs()
    When I register a user "<username>" with email "<email>" and password "<password>" # FeatureContext::iRegisterAUserWithEmailAndPassword()
    Then a user "<username>" with email "<email>" should exist                         # FeatureContext::aUserWithEmailShouldExist()

    Examples:
      | username   | email               | password    |
      | test_user  | test_user@test.com  | test_user   |
      | test_user2 | test_user2@test.com | test_user 2 |
